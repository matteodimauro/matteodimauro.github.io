This is my project thesis, created for Engineering S.p.A. I developed deep learning models using neural networks for facial expression recognition via facial feature keypoints. The project covers facial expression recognition using computer vision and deep learning techniques, demonstrating practical applications of AI in emotion detection.

**Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Keras, Neural Networks
