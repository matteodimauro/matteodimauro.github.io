## Roots: Growing up in Catania

I was born and raised in Catania, Sicily—a place where Mediterranean warmth meets strong family values. Growing up here shaped my curiosity about how things work and my drive to solve problems methodically. The city's blend of history and modernity taught me to appreciate both tradition and innovation. It's where I developed my passion for understanding complex systems and my commitment to continuous learning.

## First Steps: University of Catania

At the University of Catania, I discovered computer science. More than just learning to code, I learned how to think algorithmically and break down complex problems into manageable pieces. These years were about foundation-building—understanding data structures, algorithms, and the fundamentals that would shape my entire career. It was here I realized my passion lay at the intersection of computing and problem-solving.

## The Rome Chapter: Masters, Internships & First Full-Time Role

After completing my Bachelor's, I moved to Rome for my Master's degree at Sapienza. Rome represented a new chapter—more independence, more possibilities, and my first real exposure to professional environments. During these years, I completed my first two internships here, diving into real-world data science problems and learning how to transition from theory to practice, communicating insights to stakeholders and navigating the complexities of applied machine learning in business contexts.

My first serious full-time position also came in Rome at Allianz SE, where I worked as a Pricing Analyst and Applied Data Scientist. This was transformational—moving from project-based work to owning models in production, managing stakeholder expectations, and contributing to strategic business decisions. Here, I learned the difference between building a model and building a model that drives real value.

## Expansion & Talent Program: Master's in Milano

Pursuing my second Master's degree at Politecnico di Milano introduced me to big data at scale. As part of this journey, I participated in an exclusive talent program that accelerated my growth in machine learning and data engineering, exposing me to cutting-edge industry practices and connecting me with leading tech professionals. Milano's tech ecosystem was energizing—a hub of innovation where I refined my expertise in advanced techniques and learned how to think bigger, scale faster, and tackle problems with more rigor and sophistication.

## Current Chapter: London & Allianz UK

Now based in London as a Senior Pricing Analyst in Applied Analytics, I've stepped into a more senior role where I own the entire lifecycle of machine learning models used to guide operational decisions. London has taught me international perspectives, agility in navigating diverse teams, and the impact of taking broader ownership. Every day, I balance technical excellence with business impact, working to ensure our models don't just perform well—they create value.
