I’m a data scientist focused on problem solving.
I work with data and analytics to support real decisions, not just to build models.
I care about usefulness more than elegance.

## Roots: Growing up in Catania

I was born and raised in Catania, Sicily.
Growing up there shaped my curiosity about how things work and my way of approaching problems step by step.
It’s where I first got into computers, an interest that later turned into a clear decision: studying Computer Science at the University of Catania.

## First Steps: University of Catania

At the University of Catania, I studied Computer Science.
Those years were about building foundations: learning how to think algorithmically, break down complex problems and work through them with method.
Courses on data structures, algorithms and programming fundamentals shaped the way I still approach technical problems today.

## The Roman chapter: Master of Science, internships and my first role as a Data Scientist

Rome marked a clear transition: more independence, new responsibilities, and my first sustained exposure to professional environments.

During my Master’s, I completed my thesis through a professional internship, working on applied data science problems closely connected to real use cases. After graduating, I undertook a second internship, which allowed me to further consolidate my practical skills and continue bridging the gap between academic training and real-world applications.

My first structured role as a data scientist also came in Rome, through my entry into Allianz SE via its Talent Program selection process. I worked as a Pricing Analyst and Applied Data Scientist, contributing to analytical and modeling activities within a large, international organization.
This experience taught me how data science operates in practice inside a complex corporate environment: working with multiple stakeholders, aligning technical work with business needs, and understanding how decisions are made at scale.

## Expansion & Talent Program: Master's in Milano

Through the talent program, I had the opportunity to pursue a second-level Master’s degree in Big Data Science at Politecnico di Milano.
This experience allowed me to deepen my knowledge of big data and machine learning while continuing to build on a solid technical foundation.

A key part of this phase was the constant exchange with colleagues coming from different lines of business within the same industry. Working alongside people with diverse backgrounds helped me broaden my perspective, approach problems from multiple angles, and better understand how data is used across complex organizations.

## Current Chapter: London

After completing my Master’s and gaining solid experience within the company, I felt the need to step outside my comfort zone and take on a new challenge.
I took the opportunity to move to the London office as a Senior Pricing Analyst, entering a broader international context and working with more diverse teams and datasets.

This transition allowed me to expand my perspective, strengthen my analytical skills in a global environment, and take on greater responsibility in how data and models are used to support day-to-day decisions.

Moving from Catania to Rome, then briefly to Milan, and eventually to London has made one thing clear to me: growth often comes from stepping outside your comfort zone.
Each change of city and context pushed me to adapt, take responsibility, and see things from new perspectives, shaping the way I approach challenges and continuous learning.
